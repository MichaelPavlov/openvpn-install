This is a fork of [opnvpn installer](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) which installs all by default. Ready for fabric use.

##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/vyOBn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a little VPS for just $2.74/month for 512Mb Ram VPS at [Vicore Host](https://goo.gl/qBSASW).
